# Cabin Rental App

Frontend here: https://github.com/RyanThomasTech/cabin-rental-react-calendar

In the future I may combine these into one repo because it seems like overkill to have such a small backend be separate. For now, it's a separate repo and I can keep them linked with this as a submodule.

Commented sections are on hold until I pracice some database design principles.

## Key Takeaways

* I appreciate Go's error-first mentality, but at the same time it does make a lot of boilerplate-like code
* I can't decide on database design. Need to learn about design principles/best practices.
* I like Go's structure/syntax. It reminds me of C.
